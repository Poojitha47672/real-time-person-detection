# Real-Time Person Detection and Counting using YOLOv5

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time person detection and counting system using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model. It processes webcam feed to detect persons, draw bounding boxes, and maintain a live count.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time person detection from webcam input
- Accurate bounding box visualization
- Live person counting
- Optimized with Non-Max Suppression for better accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Object Detection Model:** YOLOv5
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab
